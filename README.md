# NROGUE
*ncurses roguelike challenge*

I decided to challenge myself by making a game with minimal requirements possible.  
Just like in old times, when all you had was just one binary file.  
Since I'm working with Linux, I thought that making a game that uses just terminal libraries (e.g. ncurses)
seems like a perfect candidate. And what games are known to use terminal graphics? That's right, roguelikes.  
So I decided to make a roguelike.  
It probably should've been named **ncrogue** or something, but whatever...
